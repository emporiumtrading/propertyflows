## Critical Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: SelectItem Empty Values
**Issue:** SelectItem components threw errors when missing value prop  
**Fix:** Added proper value props to all SelectItem components  
**Impact:** Prevented rendering errors in dropdown menus

### Bug #2: upsertUser Foreign Key Constraint Violation
**Issue:** Attempting to update user.id field violated FK constraints  
**Fix:** Exclude id from update operations in upsertUser  
**Impact:** Fixed critical database constraint violations on user updates

### Bug #3: DataManagement Infinite Loading

## Code Quality & Security Review

### Security Assessment ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Code review completed - Formal security audit recommended

**Protections Implemented (Code Review):**
- ‚úÖ SQL Injection Prevention: Drizzle ORM uses parameterized queries (server/db.ts)
- ‚úÖ Input Validation: Zod schemas on API routes (server/routes.ts)
- ‚úÖ Authentication: Replit Auth OIDC with token refresh (server/replitAuth.ts)
- ‚úÖ Authorization: Role-based middleware checks in place
- ‚úÖ Session Management: Express sessions with connect-pg-simple (server/replitAuth.ts)

**Security Gaps Identified:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è XSS Prevention: Frontend rendering not explicitly sanitized - needs review
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CSRF Protection: Not explicitly implemented - needs evaluation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limiting: Not implemented - should be added for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Headers: Content Security Policy and other headers not configured

**Recommendation:** Full security penetration testing required before production deployment

### Data-testid Coverage ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE for new features

**Coverage by Feature:**
- ‚úÖ TenantMarketplace: All buttons, filters, and cards
- ‚úÖ DataManagement: All import/export buttons and tabs
- ‚úÖ VendorDashboard: All job cards and action buttons
- ‚úÖ PayoutDashboard: All status indicators and controls

**Technical Debt Identified:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-existing pages (TenantPortal, OwnerPortal, Maintenance) missing some testids
- üìù Recommendation: Backlog item to retrofit legacy pages

### Performance Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Low priority - no critical issues

**Potential Optimizations Identified:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `getUnitsByTenant`: Sequential queries could be optimized with joins
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `getDashboardStats`: Nested fetching could use aggregation
- üìù Recommendation: Profile with realistic datasets before optimizing
