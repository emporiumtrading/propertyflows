# Security & Testing Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and working
- General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Authentication: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- Webhook exemption: Configured using `req.originalUrl`
- **Note:** E2E test coverage needs expansion to test actual threshold

### 2. CSRF Protection
**Status:** ✅ Architectural decision documented
- Not implemented (by design)
- Compensating controls in place: SameSite cookies, CORS, API-first architecture
- Deprecated csurf package removed
- Documented in SECURITY.md

### 3. Security Headers (Helmet)
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial implementation
- ✅ HSTS configured (maxAge: 31536000, includeSubDomains, preload)
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options, X-Download-Options
- ✅ upgrade-insecure-requests directive
- ⚠️ **CSP LIMITATION:** Currently allows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`
  - **Reason:** Required for Vite/React development builds
  - **Risk:** XSS vulnerability in production
  - **Solution Required:** Implement nonce-based CSP for production

### 4. Test Infrastructure
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial implementation
- ✅ Jest configuration complete
- ✅ Playwright configuration complete
- ✅ E2E security tests created
- ✅ Configuration validation tests
- ⚠️ Tests validate headers but don't fully exercise rate limiting thresholds
- ⚠️ Integration tests don't boot real server with full middleware stack

### 5. Performance Monitoring
**Status:** ⚠️ Infrastructure ready, not integrated
- ✅ Performance monitoring class (`server/performance.ts`)
- ✅ Load testing utility (`tests/performance/load-test.ts`)
- ✅ Integration documentation (`PERFORMANCE.md`)
- ⚠️ **NOT YET INTEGRATED:** No middleware or service wiring
- ⚠️ No metrics currently being collected in production

## 🔴 Critical Issues for Production

### Issue 1: CSP Vulnerability
**Problem:** Content Security Policy allows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`
**Impact:** Application vulnerable to XSS attacks
**Solution Options:**
1. Implement nonce-based CSP with Vite plugin
2. Use strict CSP with hash-based allowlist
3. Configure separate CSP for dev vs production

**Implementation Required:**
```typescript
// Production CSP (requires Vite plugin)
const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64');
res.locals.nonce = nonce;

helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", `'nonce-${nonce}'`],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", `'nonce-${nonce}'`],
      // Remove unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval
    },
  },
});
```

### Issue 2: Incomplete Test Coverage
**Problem:** Tests don't fully validate security features against real server
**Impact:** Security configurations may not work as intended
**Solution Required:**
1. Create integration tests that start real Express server
2. Test rate limiting by exceeding thresholds
3. Validate webhook exemption with actual requests
4. Test authentication flows end-to-end

### Issue 3: Performance Monitoring Not Active
**Problem:** Monitoring tools exist but aren't collecting metrics
**Impact:** No visibility into production performance
**Solution Required:**
1. Add middleware integration (see PERFORMANCE.md)
2. Wire into database operations
3. Track external API calls
4. Create metrics endpoint

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix CSP (Critical):**
   - Research Vite CSP nonce plugins
   - Implement nonce-based policy
   - Remove unsafe directives
   - Test in production build

2. **Enhance Test Coverage:**
   - Create integration test harness
   - Test rate limiting with > 100 requests
   - Validate webhook exemption
   - Test authentication flows

3. **Integrate Performance Monitoring:**
   - Add middleware (see PERFORMANCE.md)
   - Wire into critical paths
   - Create metrics endpoint
   - Set up monitoring dashboard
