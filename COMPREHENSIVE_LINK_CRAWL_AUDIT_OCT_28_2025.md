## Code Quality Observations

### ✅ Excellent Patterns Found

1. **Consistent Data TestIDs:**
   - Every interactive element has `data-testid` attributes
   - Following pattern: `{action}-{target}` and `{type}-{content}`
   - Examples: `button-submit`, `input-email`, `link-profile`

2. **No Hardcoded URLs:**
   - All external URLs use proper social media links
   - No `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` references found
   - Environment-aware configuration

3. **Proper Error Handling:**
   - Console statements limited to error logging only
   - Found 1 instance in `Payments.tsx` (acceptable for error handling)
   - No debug `console.log` statements

4. **Type Safety:**
   - TypeScript throughout
   - Proper use of Zod schemas
   - Type inference from database schema

5. **Accessibility:**
   - Proper ARIA labels on icon-only buttons
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Keyboard navigation support

### ✅ Expected Patterns (Not Issues)

1. **Input Placeholders:**
   - Form inputs have placeholder text (e.g., "Enter email", "Select option")
   - This is correct UX pattern, not a bug

2. **Blog Posts:**
   - "Read More" buttons without routes
   - Expected for static content on public pages
   - Would link to full posts in production

3. **Careers:**
   - "Apply Now" buttons without routes
   - Expected for static job listings
   - Would link to application forms in production

4. **Contact Info:**
   - Demo phone: 1-800-555-1234
   - Demo emails: support@propertyflows.co, sales@propertyflows.co
   - Standard practice for SaaS landing pages
