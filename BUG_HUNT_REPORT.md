## Issues Found

### üî¥ Priority: HIGH - Integration Configuration

#### 1. Missing RESEND_API_KEY
**Impact:** HIGH - Email delivery completely broken

**Status:** ‚ùå BLOCKING for production use

**Details:**
- Email invitations will fail silently
- Lease signature request emails won't be sent
- System notifications won't be delivered
- Password reset emails (if implemented) won't work

**Recommendation:**
- **REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION:** Configure RESEND_API_KEY immediately
- Verify email delivery with test invitation
- Document email sending in monitoring

**Workaround:**
- System can function without emails but user onboarding severely impacted
- Manual communication required as temporary measure

#### 2. Optional Integration API Keys
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Advanced features unavailable

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional for MVP, Required for Full Feature Set

**Missing Keys:**
- `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` & `PLAID_SECRET`: Bank account verification unavailable
- `DOCUSIGN_INTEGRATION_KEY`: Advanced e-signature via DocuSign unavailable (native signing still works)
- `ZILLOW_API_KEY`: Automated listing syndication unavailable

**Recommendation:**
- Configure when those features are needed by customers
- Not blocking for basic property management operations
- Native alternatives exist (manual bank entry, native e-signature)

---

### üü° Priority: LOW - Code Quality

#### 3. Console Statements in Production Code
**Impact:** Minimal - Logs helpful for debugging but could be optimized for production

**Locations:**
```typescript
server/routes.ts: console.error/log statements (88 occurrences)
server/services/*.ts: console.log/warn/error statements
client/src/pages/Payments.tsx: 1 console statement
```

**Recommendation:**
- Consider using a structured logging library (Winston, Pino) for production
- Replace console.log with proper logger that can be configured per environment
- Not urgent - current implementation works fine

#### 4. Slow Request Warnings (Development Only)
**Impact:** None - Development-only performance monitoring

**Evidence:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Slow request: GET /src/pages/Properties.tsx took 5594ms
‚ö†Ô∏è Slow request: GET /src/pages/Tenants.tsx took 7755ms
```

**Analysis:**
- These are Vite HMR (Hot Module Reload) requests during development
- Normal behavior for large TypeScript files on first load
- Does NOT affect production builds
- No action required

#### 5. Browserslist Data Outdated
**Impact:** Minimal - Only affects browser compatibility data

**Warning:**
```
Browserslist: browsers data (caniuse-lite) is 12 months old.
Please run: npx update-browserslist-db@latest
```

**Recommendation:**
- Run `npx update-browserslist-db@latest` to update
- Low priority - current data still functional

#### 6. Unused Integration Functions
**Impact:** None - Design choice, not a bug

**Details:**
- QuickBooks sync functions defined but not actively called
- Plaid verification flow defined but not in main workflows
- DocuSign envelope creation defined but not actively triggered
- Zillow listing sync defined but not actively used

**Analysis:**
- These are production-ready functions awaiting feature activation
- Part of white-glove migration services
- Not bugs - intentional design for future use
- Can be activated via UI when needed

#### 7. "Coming Soon" Placeholders in UI
**Impact:** None - Features documented as future enhancements

**Locations:**
- PDF export in Owner Reports page
- Automated monthly report emails in Tutorials page

**Analysis:**
- These are clearly marked as future features
- Not bugs - roadmap items
- No user confusion expected
