### 2. Stripe Payment Bug Fix ✅
**Status:** FIXED - Critical Bug Resolved

**Bug Description:**
- Payments were not being linked to the correct lease
- Payment records showed "Unknown" for tenant and property
- Webhook wasn't creating payment records from metadata

**Root Cause:**
- `POST /api/payments/create-intent` created Stripe PaymentIntent with leaseId in metadata
- Stripe webhook `payment_intent.succeeded` only updated existing payments
- No payment record was created when payment succeeded

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `server/routes.ts` webhook handler (line 4945-4989):
```typescript
case 'payment_intent.succeeded': {
  const paymentIntent = event.data.object as any;
  const stripePaymentIntentId = paymentIntent.id;
  
  const payments = await storage.getPayments();
  const payment = payments.find((p: any) => p.stripePaymentIntentId === stripePaymentIntentId);
  
  if (payment) {
    // Update existing payment
    await storage.updatePayment(payment.id, {
      status: 'completed',
      paidAt: new Date(),
    });
  } else {
    // NEW: Create payment from metadata
    const metadata = paymentIntent.metadata || {};
    const leaseId = metadata.leaseId;
    const paymentMethod = metadata.paymentMethod || 'credit_card';
    const processingFee = parseFloat(metadata.processingFee || '0');
    const amount = paymentIntent.amount / 100;
    const rentAmount = amount - processingFee;
    
    if (leaseId) {
      const lease = await storage.getLease(leaseId);
      if (lease) {
        const newPayment = await storage.createPayment({
          leaseId: leaseId,
          tenantId: lease.tenantId,
          amount: rentAmount.toString(),
          paymentMethod: paymentMethod,
          status: 'completed',
          dueDate: new Date().toISOString(),
          paidAt: new Date(),
          stripePaymentIntentId: stripePaymentIntentId,
          processingFee: processingFee.toString(),
        });
        console.log(`[Stripe Webhook] Created payment record for lease ${leaseId}`);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Payments now correctly linked to selected lease
- ✅ Payment records show correct tenant and property info
- ✅ Webhook creates payment from metadata when needed
- ✅ No more "Unknown" tenant/property displays

---

### 3. Code Quality Improvements ✅

#### A. Structured Logging System ✅
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**What Was Done:**
- Created `server/logger.ts` with Winston logger
- Configured daily log rotation for production
- Environment-based log levels (debug in dev, info in prod)
- Console transport for development, file transport for production

**File Created:**
- `server/logger.ts` - Winston logger with:
  - Color-coded console output
  - Daily rotating file logs
  - Error and combined log files
  - 14-day retention policy

**Usage:**
```typescript
import logger from './logger';

logger.info('User logged in');
logger.error('Failed to process payment');
logger.debug('Debugging information');
```

**Next Steps:**
- Replace console statements in critical services (optional post-launch)
- Currently: Console logging works fine, Winston ready when needed

#### B. Browserslist Database Update ✅
**Status:** UPDATED

**What Was Done:**
- Ran `npx update-browserslist-db@latest`
- Updated caniuse-lite from v1.0.30001677 to v1.0.30001751
- Browser compatibility data now current

**Result:**
- ✅ No more outdated browserslist warnings
- ✅ Accurate browser compatibility checking
